## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
pip install requests aiohttp chardet beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn
## Step 2: Open Python File and Import Libraries
### Explanation of Each Library
- chardet: Detects the character encoding of webpage content. Webpages use different encodings, and chardet helps identify the correct one to decode content properly.
- requests:A popular library for making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content. It allows us to access URLs and get HTML responses easily.
- asyncio: A library to write asynchronous code. It helps manage multiple tasks at the same time, like fetching several URLs, without slowing down the program.
- aiohttp: An asynchronous HTTP client that works with asyncio. It allows us to send multiple requests at once, making the process of fetching webpage content faster.
- logging: A built-in library for tracking and recording the scriptâ€™s activity. It helps log any issues, warnings, or errors during execution for easy debugging.
- scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer and cosine_similarity):
- TfidfVectorizer: Converts text data into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF method, helping us understand the importance of words in documents.
- cosine_similarity: Measures the similarity between the vectors generated by TfidfVectorizer, allowing us to find out how similar two texts are.
- csv: A built-in library for reading from and writing to CSV files. We will use this to save the suggested interlinks and URLs without suggestions.
- beautifulsoup4 (bs4): A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It allows us to extract and clean text from HTML content, making it ready for further analysis.
## Step 3:  Setting Up Basic Logging Configuration in Python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
The line logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) sets up the basic configuration for the logging system in Python. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

logging: This is the Python logging module used for tracking events during the execution of code. It helps in debugging and monitoring the behavior of the program.
basicConfig(): This function configures the logging system with basic settings, such as the log level and the format of log messages.
level=logging.INFO: This sets the logging level to INFO.
The logging level determines the severity of messages that will be logged. In this case, INFO is set, meaning that messages at the INFO level and above (like WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL) will be logged.
INFO level logs are used to show general information about the execution flow, such as the start or completion of tasks, status updates, and other important events.
So, this line configures the logger to show informational messages, making it easier to track and monitor the script's behavior as it runs.
